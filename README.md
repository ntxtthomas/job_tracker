# Career Intelligence

A Rails 8 application for tracking, analyzing, and strategizing a job search. Built to centralize opportunity tracking, interview preparation, technology demand analysis, and career narrative development — turning raw job search activity into actionable intelligence.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4.6
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Node.js (for asset compilation, if needed)
- Bundler

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntxtthomas/career_intelligence.git
cd career_intelligence
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. Registration is disabled — the owner account is created via `db:seed` using these credentials:

```dotenv
OWNER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
OWNER_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

> The database defaults in `config/database.yml` should work without additional configuration for most local PostgreSQL setups. Only add `DATABASE_*` variables if your setup differs.

### 4. Set up the database

```bash
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails db:seed
```

Seeding creates an owner user (from your `.env` values), a demo user, and 75 technologies across 6 categories with sample demo data.

### 5. Start the server

```bash
bin/dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard.

## Running Tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

The CI pipeline also runs on every PR and push to `main`:

| Job         | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scan_ruby` | Brakeman security analysis                                               |
| `scan_js`   | Importmap dependency audit                                               |
| `lint`      | RuboCop style enforcement                                                |
| `test`      | Full RSpec suite with PostgreSQL service                                 |
| `deploy`    | Build & push Docker image to ECR, deploy to EC2 via SSM (manual trigger) |
